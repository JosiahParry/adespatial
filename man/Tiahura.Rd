 (see details). }

\description{
Observation of fish community composition, ecological traits, and
environmental characteristics observed along a 1-km coral reef transect.

\details{
The Tiahura fish transect data is described and analyzed by
Galzin & Legendre (1987) consists of presence/absence data for 280 fish
species observed at $22$ sites along a 1.02 km long coast-to-sea cross-reef
transect located near the northwestern corner of the high volcanic island of
Moorea (French Polynesia; WGS84: -17.4934, -149.8680). Survey sites were
50 m long. Species presence/absence data were recorded by a diver trained in
underwater fish identification. The transect began on a coral sand beach,
followed by a zone of detritic sediments, then a dying reef flat, followed by
a zone of coral patches. That relatively flat area ended into a 100-m wide -
9-m deep channel followed by a 490-m wide barrier reef, which ended in a
slightly elevated reef ridge, followed by the outer slope in the Pacific
Ocean. The survey was terminated at depth of approximately 25 m; the maximum
depth allowing scuba diving for any length of time without having to perform
decompression stops. For further details about the transect and survey
method, see Galzin & Legendre (1987).

Ecological traits contained in data frame \code{trait} are
\describe{
\item{Feeding}{ A seven-level categorical variables describing the feeding
habit of the fishes }
\item{Ecology}{ A seven-level categorical variable describing the general
behavior of the fishes in their habitat }
\item{Adult}{ A six-level ordered variables describing the adult size of the
fishes }
\item{Egg}{ A three-level categorical variable describing the types of eggs
laid by the fishes }
\item{Activity}{ A three-level categorical variable describing the general
timing of fish activity }
}

Environmental characteristics contained in data frame \code{habitat} are the
distance from the shore (in m), the depth of the site (in cm), and substrate
composition. Substrate composition (environmental characteristics 3 - 10),
were percentage coverage indices of the reef bottom by different materials,
based on 50 observation points. These observations points were disposed at
1-m intervals along a 50-m rope. The variables report what proportion of the
50 readings pertained to each category of substrate. Several of these
categories represent biological material lying on top of, intermingled with,
or attached to the mineral substrate. When the 22 stations are considered
globally, these eight categories of substrate respectively represent 2.5%,
31.1%, 11.4%, 14.3%, 13.9%, 18.7%, 7.5%, and 0.7% of the observed points.

Data frame \code{reef}, which contains the boundaries of the different
sections of the transect, comes in handy for displaying data graphically and
interprete results.

This data set was made available to the students in the European Advanced
Course "Numerical Analysis in Marine Ecology", Villefranche-sur-Mer,
3 - 20 July 1996.
